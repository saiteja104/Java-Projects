Java OOP Projects
Welcome to the Java OOP Projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of Java applications that demonstrate the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each project is designed to solve specific real-world problems using Java.

Projects Overview
1. Bank Account Application
A simple banking application that allows users to create and manage their bank accounts. The application provides functionalities for:

Concepts Demonstrated
The projects in this repository highlight the following OOP concepts:

Classes and Objects: Fundamental building blocks of OOP, used to create objects that represent real-world entities.
Inheritance: Mechanism to create a new class using properties and methods of an existing class.
Polymorphism: Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
Encapsulation: Bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
